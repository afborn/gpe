#### A collection of jupyter notebooks to automate some bioinformatic steps for genome-engineering projects.
Module gpe contains functions and modules used in the notebooks.
Notebooks included so far help to analyse if clones are knockout clones based on providing gRNA and sequencing data, as well as scrape gRNA predictions for human genes.
Human genes should be supplied as a list in the form of ENSEMBL gene id's.
